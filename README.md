📌 Overview

The DrumKit project simulates a real drum kit experience directly in the browser. Each drum button is mapped to a unique sound and can be triggered either by pressing specific keyboard keys or by clicking on the on-screen buttons. Real-time visual feedback and smooth animations enhance user interaction and engagement.

This project focuses on building strong fundamentals in front-end logic, interactive UI design, and JavaScript-based event-driven programming.
